# 🧮 Python Calculator (Tkinter)
A powerful, stylish desktop calculator built with Python’s Tkinter library. This project combines a modern user interface, robust arithmetic capabilities, and keyboard interaction for an efficient, user-friendly experience. Designed for everyday use and for anyone looking to explore Python GUI application development.

## 📖 Overview
This calculator application demonstrates how to create a rich desktop GUI tool using Python’s Tkinter library. More than a simple number cruncher, the app enables real-time keyboard input, visually appealing layouts, and support for both basic and advanced math operations including squaring and square roots.
Whether you’re a beginner seeking to learn about GUI programming, or looking for a practical, customizable desktop tool, this calculator provides a solid foundation.

## 🚩 Features
- **Modern User Interface**: Clean, large display labels, organized buttons, and responsive layout.
- **Full Arithmetic Support**: Add, subtract, multiply (`×`), and divide (`÷`), plus decimal point and parentheses.
- **Advanced Math**: Instantly compute square (`x²`) and square root (`√x`) with dedicated buttons.
- **Immediate Calculation**: Results are displayed instantly after pressing the equals button or Enter.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Type numbers and operators right from your keyboard for fast data entry.
- **Clear & Reset**: Easily clear your current or entire expression with a single click or keypress.
- **Error Handling**: Invalid input or division by zero are handled gracefully with clear error messages.
- **Non-Resizable Window**: Professional, fixed layout ensures that the interface always looks perfect, with no distortions.

## ⚙️ System Architecture
The calculator application is structured as follows:
- **User Interface Layer**: Created with Tkinter widgets (`Frame`, `Label`, `Button`). All controls (digit, operator, special function buttons) reside in an organized grid, while display labels show the current and total expressions.
- **Event Handling**: Button clicks and keyboard inputs are mapped to handler methods. Users can interact purely with mouse, keyboard, or both.
- **Computation Engine**: All expressions are processed using Python’s built-in `eval()` safely within restricted contexts. Square and square root operations are handled as custom logic.
- **Error Handling**: Try/except blocks ensure that all invalid operations show user-friendly errors instead of crashing.
- **Extensible Design**: Modular, class-based structure for easy future enhancements (e.g., advanced scientific functions, memory storage) and code reuse.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone This Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-calculator-tkinter.git
    cd python-calculator-tkinter
    ```
2. **Ensure Python is Installed**
    - Requires Python 3.x (Tkinter is included in standard installations)

3. **Run the Calculator**
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage Guide
- **Mouse**: Click buttons on the calculator interface to enter numbers, choose operations, and get results.
- **Keyboard**: Type digits and operators directly; use Enter for equals, C for clear.
- **Operators**: Addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), division (÷), decimal (.), parentheses, square (`x²`), and square root (`√x`).
- **Clear**: Use the C button or the relevant keyboard key to clear input and start fresh.
- **Result**: Press "=" or Enter after your calculation to see results appear instantly.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**: Core language and backend expression handling
- **Tkinter**: GUI application framework—buttons, labels, layout
- **Standard Libraries Only**: No external dependencies needed

**Elegant. Reliable. Efficient. Try modern math with one click—or one keystroke!**
